Throughout my tenure EMA-Bangladesh has grown into a dynamic and supportive community, offering students and professionals access to European education, scholarships, cultural exchange, and numerous opportunities for personal and professional development. \nAt the start of my journey, I initiated the formation of a local volunteer team comprised of Erasmus+ scholars and alumni, allowing us to extend our outreach across Bangladesh. This team became the driving force behind our activities, ensuring that students from diverse backgrounds were aware of the opportunities offered by Erasmus+. As our efforts gained momentum, we strengthened collaboration with the European Union Delegation (EUD) to Bangladesh, working together on roadshows, study fairs, and joint projects that promoted European education. During the period, it has been possible for us to organize more than 200 events, including seminars, workshops, all designed to promote Erasmus+ opportunities throughout the country. \nEMA-BD transcends mere organizational status; it represents a community which offers a platform for growth, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing. Our website is a testament to our collective efforts, providing a digital space where Erasmus+ scholars from Bangladesh can connect, share their professional experiences, and support one another. This website will be a vital resource, building bridges between current scholars, alumni, and prospective students. Furthering our impact, launching of the first-ever workshop series has been a great success. Workshop series led by Erasmus+ scholars, has helped many scholarship and job aspirants better prepare for their future endeavours. This effort has proven particularly gratifying since it directly met the community's needs, providing individuals with the resources for success. Being a part of EMA-BD has profoundly influenced my personal and professional development, and the most rewarding aspect of being a CR has been witnessing the positive impact our initiatives have had on the lives of so many. Though challenges came our way, including managing a growing community while balancing other commitments, the teamwork and dedication of our members always saw us through. \nI anticipate that the forthcoming generation of leaders will uphold this legacy and elevate EMA￾Bangladesh to unprecedented levels. Let us maintain our dedication to promoting inclusivity, collaboration, and the unifying spirit of Erasmus+. \n\nThank you. \nSayed Muhammad Baker \nCountry Representative for Bangladesh [2020-2024] \nErasmus Mundus Association (EMA-AISBL) ",

        "keynote": "The Erasmus Mundus scholarship has been a transformative journey, not just for me, but for countless students who have sought out new opportunities and perspectives across borders. It is a unique privilege to be part of a global network that fosters not only academic excellence but also cultural exchange and collaboration.My Erasmus journey has opened doors to institutions and experiences that have shaped my academic and professional trajectory in ways I could not have imagined. From stepping into some of the most advanced research facilities to engaging with vibrant student communities, I have seen firsthand how Erasmus Mundus empowers students to think beyond traditional boundaries, to innovate, and to contribute meaningfully to global conversations. As members of Erasmus Mundus Association Bangladesh, we stand at the intersection of global education and local impact. Our responsibility goes beyond academic achievement; it extends to how we contribute to the development of our nation, using the skills and knowledge we have gained from this exceptional opportunity. Over the years, our alumni have exemplified this through their leadership, not only within the academic sphere but also in driving initiatives that have had a tangible impact on society, from educational outreach programs to community development efforts. The Erasmus Mundus community in Bangladesh has grown remarkably, with alumni from diverse disciplines coming together to share their experiences and support future scholars. This collaborative spirit has been key to promoting the Erasmus+ program and ensuring that young students, regardless of their background or institution, are aware of the opportunities available to them. Our work in raising awareness and guiding applicants through the process has opened the doors for many who may have otherwise missed out. Looking ahead, our goals must remain ambitious. We aim to strengthen our community further, expand our outreach, and work in collaboration with institutions and the European Delegation to ensure that Bangladesh remains an active and dynamic participant in the Erasmus Mundus network. The future holds immense potential, and it is up to us to harness that potential to benefit both our country and the global community. In closing, I would like to express my gratitude to the Erasmus Mundus Association for its unwavering support and to all the alumni and scholars who continue to contribute to the success of this program. Together, we are building bridges of knowledge, understanding, and collaboration that transcend borders. \n\nThank you. \nRajon Bhuiyan \nCountry Representative for Bangladesh [2020-2021] \nErasmus Mundus Association (EMA-AISBL) ",

        "keynote": "Reflecting on my journey with Erasmus Mundus Association (EMA), my heart fills with deep pride and gratitude for the community that has shaped my life in countless ways. EMA, at its core, is not just a network—it is a global family that transcends borders, bringing together scholars, alumni, and professionals from diverse backgrounds to create something truly extraordinary. As I serve as the current President, I am constantly reminded of the profound impact this community has had, both on a personal and collective level. \nMy leadership story began in Bangladesh, where I was honored to serve as the elected Country Representative (CR) for EMA Bangladesh for two consecutive terms from 2016 to 2019. Stepping into this role, our social media presence had around 1,500 followers. Today, that number has grown to around 50,000—an incredible testament to the impact we have created together. This growth reflects not just the increased visibility of EMA Bangladesh but also the trust, passion, and dedication of our members who have worked tirelessly to promote Erasmus Mundus opportunities and expand our reach. One of the most rewarding aspects of being CR was seeing our collective efforts make a tangible impact, such as during our humanitarian project 2018 for flood-affected communities in Bangladesh, and our COVID-19 initiatives, where we mobilized aid and support, reinforcing the values of empathy and solidarity within our community.\nLeading EMA Bangladesh during those years was transformative. I saw firsthand how the power of collaboration, teamwork, and shared vision can drive change, not just in the lives of individual members but in entire communities. Of course, the journey was not without challenges. Balancing my responsibilities as CR with my other professional commitments was often difficult, especially as the demands of our growing chapter intensified. However, it was through trust, delegation, and the unwavering support of EMA Bangladesh team that I was able to navigate these challenges. I learned that leadership is not about standing alone at the forefront but about empowering others to lead alongside you. This philosophy has guided me through every role I’ve taken on since, from CR to Vice President, and now as the President of EMA.\nWhat stands out most from my time in EMA Bangladesh is the community we built—a community that thrives on inclusivity, diversity, and a shared commitment to excellence. EMA Bangladesh will always hold a special place in my heart because it is where this journey began. The bonds we formed and the impact we made will continue to inspire me as I lead EMA on a global scale.\nAs I look forward, I know that EMA Bangladesh will continue to serve as a beacon of inspiration and leadership. Together, we have laid a foundation of growth, compassion, and resilience that will guide future leaders and members. I am eternally grateful for the opportunities this community has given me and for the chance to give back to a network that has shaped me in immeasurable ways. \nOur journey is far from over—the best is yet to come.\n\nDr. Md Ashiqur Rahman \nPresident, Erasmus Mundus Association (EMA)",

        "keynote": "The Erasmus Mundus scholarship significantly shaped my career by providing the opportunity for higher studies abroad. It was a crucial stepping stone that helped me build my professional path, particularly as a first-generation college student from a lower-middle-income family. It enabled me to pursue my dream career. After completing my degree and serving as one of the first Country Representatives of EMA Bangladesh, I played key roles in building the EMA BD community and promoting the Erasmus+ scholarship among young students at various universities in Bangladesh. Our Bangladesh team was the first to top the list in celebrating EMA Day in the history of the EMA association. \nFollowing my tenure, while serving in multiple roles within the South Asian Chapter, I continued collaborating with alumni in Bangladesh to strengthen our professional network, disseminate scholarship information to young professionals, and support them during post-application visa processes with the assistance of the European Delegation to Bangladesh. From 2013 to 2019, one of our key achievements was raising awareness about scholarship opportunities beyond public universities. As a result, a significant number of scholarship recipients now come from private universities in Bangladesh, who were previously underserved due to limited access to information.\nOver the years, our BD alumni have not only expanded activities within the country but have also taken leadership roles in EMA’s core committees. We have engaged in community outreach beyond academic pursuits, supporting vulnerable communities during the pandemic and in response to natural disasters. I hope to see EMA BD receive official support from the European Commission to further its vision and mission.\n\nThank you.\nDr. Ram Krishna Mazumder\nFormer Country Representative for Bangladesh \nErasmus Mundus Association (EMA-AISBL)",

        "keynote": "Each of us here shares a unique story of discovery, growth, and transformation—made possible through the opportunities provided by the Erasmus Mundus program. The experience of studying in different countries, engaging with diverse academic disciplines, and forging friendships with people from around the world is something that stays with you for a lifetime. The Erasmus Mundus scholarship has not only equipped us with world-class education but also a global mindset. It has broadened our horizons, teaching us that solutions to the world challenges are best found when we come together, sharing perspectives and knowledge. I believe this is one of the most profound impacts of the Erasmus Mundus experience—it doesn’t just build careers, it builds a sense of global citizenship. Here in Bangladesh, the Erasmus Mundus Association plays a pivotal role in fostering that sense of community. Our alumni network has become a vital resource for aspiring scholars, guiding them through the application process, sharing experiences, and offering mentorship. This sense of solidarity and shared purpose is what makes our association so special. We don’t just help individuals succeed abroad; we come together to bring that success back home, enriching our own communities. Over the years, we have witnessed remarkable growth in the number of students from Bangladesh benefitting from this program. This is a testament to our collective efforts in promoting Erasmus+ opportunities to a broader audience. Many of these scholars now lead in fields such as research, education, and public service, contributing to the development of Bangladesh while staying connected to the global Erasmus Mundus network. But our journey doesn’t end with academic achievement. We must continue to nurture this network and leverage it for the benefit of future generations. Whether it's sharing knowledge, collaborating on projects, or providing support during challenging times, the strength of our association lies in our ability to uplift one another. As we move forward, I envision our alumni playing an even greater role in not only promoting the Erasmus program but also in fostering innovation and collaboration that addresses the needs of our society. I encourage all of us to remain active, to keep reaching out to potential scholars, and to expand the reach of Erasmus Mundus in Bangladesh. We have the ability to shape a future where more students, from all walks of life, can access the opportunities that we were so fortunate to receive. Let us continue to be ambassadors of the values Erasmus Mundus stands for—excellence, inclusivity, and global cooperation. Thank you to the Erasmus Mundus Association and to everyone who has contributed to this incredible journey. Together, we are making a lasting impact, not only on our own lives but on the future of education and global collaboration. \n\nThank you.\nArchitect Sazzad Hossain\nFormer Country Representative for Bangladesh \nErasmus Mundus Association (EMA-AISBL)",
