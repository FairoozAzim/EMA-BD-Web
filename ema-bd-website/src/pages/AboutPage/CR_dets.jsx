        "keynote": "The Erasmus Mundus scholarship significantly shaped my career by providing the opportunity for higher studies abroad. It was a crucial stepping stone that helped me build my professional path, particularly as a first-generation college student from a lower-middle-income family. It enabled me to pursue my dream career. After completing my degree and serving as one of the first Country Representatives of EMA Bangladesh, I played key roles in building the EMA BD community and promoting the Erasmus+ scholarship among young students at various universities in Bangladesh. Our Bangladesh team was the first to top the list in celebrating EMA Day in the history of the EMA association. \nFollowing my tenure, while serving in multiple roles within the South Asian Chapter, I continued collaborating with alumni in Bangladesh to strengthen our professional network, disseminate scholarship information to young professionals, and support them during post-application visa processes with the assistance of the European Delegation to Bangladesh. From 2013 to 2019, one of our key achievements was raising awareness about scholarship opportunities beyond public universities. As a result, a significant number of scholarship recipients now come from private universities in Bangladesh, who were previously underserved due to limited access to information.\nOver the years, our BD alumni have not only expanded activities within the country but have also taken leadership roles in EMA’s core committees. We have engaged in community outreach beyond academic pursuits, supporting vulnerable communities during the pandemic and in response to natural disasters. I hope to see EMA BD receive official support from the European Commission to further its vision and mission.\n\nThank you.\nDr. Ram Krishna Mazumder\nFormer Country Representative for Bangladesh \nErasmus Mundus Association (EMA-AISBL)",

    "keynote": "Reflecting on my journey with Erasmus Mundus Association (EMA), my heart fills with deep pride and gratitude for the community that has shaped my life in countless ways. EMA, at its core, is not just a network—it is a global family that transcends borders, bringing together scholars, alumni, and professionals from diverse backgrounds to create something truly extraordinary. As I serve as the current President, I am constantly reminded of the profound impact this community has had, both on a personal and collective level. \nMy leadership story began in Bangladesh, where I was honored to serve as the elected Country Representative (CR) for EMA Bangladesh for two consecutive terms from 2016 to 2019. Stepping into this role, our social media presence had around 1,500 followers. Today, that number has grown to around 50,000—an incredible testament to the impact we have created together. This growth reflects not just the increased visibility of EMA Bangladesh but also the trust, passion, and dedication of our members who have worked tirelessly to promote Erasmus Mundus opportunities and expand our reach. One of the most rewarding aspects of being CR was seeing our collective efforts make a tangible impact, such as during our humanitarian project 2018 for flood-affected communities in Bangladesh, and our COVID-19 initiatives, where we mobilized aid and support, reinforcing the values of empathy and solidarity within our community.\nLeading EMA Bangladesh during those years was transformative. I saw firsthand how the power of collaboration, teamwork, and shared vision can drive change, not just in the lives of individual members but in entire communities. Of course, the journey was not without challenges. Balancing my responsibilities as CR with my other professional commitments was often difficult, especially as the demands of our growing chapter intensified. However, it was through trust, delegation, and the unwavering support of EMA Bangladesh team that I was able to navigate these challenges. I learned that leadership is not about standing alone at the forefront but about empowering others to lead alongside you. This philosophy has guided me through every role I’ve taken on since, from CR to Vice President, and now as the President of EMA.\nWhat stands out most from my time in EMA Bangladesh is the community we built—a community that thrives on inclusivity, diversity, and a shared commitment to excellence. EMA Bangladesh will always hold a special place in my heart because it is where this journey began. The bonds we formed and the impact we made will continue to inspire me as I lead EMA on a global scale.\nAs I look forward, I know that EMA Bangladesh will continue to serve as a beacon of inspiration and leadership. Together, we have laid a foundation of growth, compassion, and resilience that will guide future leaders and members. I am eternally grateful for the opportunities this community has given me and for the chance to give back to a network that has shaped me in immeasurable ways. \nOur journey is far from over—the best is yet to come.\n\nDr. Md Ashiqur Rahman \nPresident, Erasmus Mundus Association (EMA)",

    "keynote": "I am honoured address you today as the Country Representative for Bangladesh of the Erasmus Mundus Association (EMA-AISBL). Throughout my tenure EMA-Bangladesh has grown into a dynamic and supportive community, offering students and professionals access to European education, scholarships, cultural exchange, and numerous opportunities for personal and professional development. \nAt the start of my journey, I initiated the formation of a local volunteer team comprised of Erasmus+ scholars and alumni, allowing us to extend our outreach across Bangladesh. This team became the driving force behind our activities, ensuring that students from diverse backgrounds were aware of the opportunities offered by Erasmus+. As our efforts gained momentum, we strengthened collaboration with the European Union Delegation (EUD) to Bangladesh, working together on roadshows, study fairs, and joint projects that promoted European education. During the period, it has been possible for us to organize more than 200 events, including seminars, workshops, all designed to promote Erasmus+ opportunities throughout the country. \nEMA-BD transcends mere organizational status; it represents a community which offers a platform for growth, collaboration, and knowledge-sharing. Our website is a testament to our collective efforts, providing a digital space where Erasmus+ scholars from Bangladesh can connect, share their professional experiences, and support one another. This website will be a vital resource, building bridges between current scholars, alumni, and prospective students. Furthering our impact, launching of the first-ever workshop series has been a great success. Workshop series led by Erasmus+ scholars, has helped many scholarship and job aspirants better prepare for their future endeavours. This effort has proven particularly gratifying since it directly met the community's needs, providing individuals with the resources for success. Being a part of EMA-BD has profoundly influenced my personal and professional development, and the most rewarding aspect of being a CR has been witnessing the positive impact our initiatives have had on the lives of so many. Though challenges came our way, including managing a growing community while balancing other commitments, the teamwork and dedication of our members always saw us through. \nI anticipate that the forthcoming generation of leaders will uphold this legacy and elevate EMA￾Bangladesh to unprecedented levels. Let us maintain our dedication to promoting inclusivity, collaboration, and the unifying spirit of Erasmus+. \n\nThank you. \nSayed Muhammad Baker \nCountry Representative for Bangladesh [2020-2024] \nErasmus Mundus Association (EMA-AISBL) ",
