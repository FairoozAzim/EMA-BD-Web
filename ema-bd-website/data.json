Beginning in 2014, Erasmus Mundus became part of the Erasmus+ funding scheme umbrella which lasted until 2020. The Erasmus+ scheme was renewed for the period of 2021-2027 and is expected to triple the number of participants. While the Erasmus Mundus Joint Ph.D. degrees no longer exist, Erasmus Mundus Joint Master Degree (EMJMD) programs continue to be offered under the umbrella of Erasmus+.\nErasmus Mundus Joint Master Degrees (EMJMDs)\n Joint Master-level study programs carried out by consortia of European universities\n Provide a number of scholarships for students from the whole world to study in Europe.\n Give the students a chance to study in at least two European countries.\n Offer multiple or joint Master’s degrees at the end of successful completion of the program.\nErasmus Mundus degrees have earned a reputation as highly competitive master’s and doctoral (not available anymore) programs that offer students the opportunity to study at several European and partner universities, invariably leading to joint or multiple university degrees.\nDuring this Master's program, a student has to study in at least two different universities in two different countries and also has the opportunity to study in more than two countries. Erasmus+ funds scholarships for students to take part in these master's programs. Last year (2022-2024 cohort) 151 Bangladeshi received this prestigious scholarship to study various Erasmus Mundus Master Programs throughout Europe. Globally, Bangladesh was in 3rd position that year regarding the number of scholarships winner. The amount of the scholarship can be 49K EURO (almost half a crore taka).\nErasmus Mundus scholarships cover a range of expenses, including tuition fees, travel costs, and living expenses. The program also provides support for academic staff to teach or conduct research at partner universities.\nFeel free to fill up a Google form to attend this webinar:\nhttps:\/\/docs.google.com\/...\/1FAIpQLSf3OlBTrWW...\/viewform...",
